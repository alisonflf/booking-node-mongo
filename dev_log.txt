I choosed the solution 1 because i had a clearer vision of what i could do.

After reading and deciding what would i do, i listed this to guide me:

    (ok) add and list tables
    (ok) make, edit and cancel bookings (1 hour slots)
    (ok) set restaurant time range


I decided to follow the sugestion od using Koa.js so i could test Koa.js wich i had not use it yet.

To keep it simple i have decided to keep the bookings on the tables collection as a property of the document.
on a real application i would probably have the reservations on a different collection 
so i would manage it better with transactions.

I have decided to not allow editing the booking time, since i am using the datetime to indentify the booking.
then the booking can be removed and recreated on the desired date.


    - create tests
    - validate body entries data
    - complete READ.ME
