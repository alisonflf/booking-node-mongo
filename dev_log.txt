This project took me 8-10 hours

I choosed the solution 1 because i had a clearer vision of what i could do.

After reading and deciding what would i do, i listed this to guide me:

    add and list tables
    make, edit and cancel bookings (1 hour slots)
    set restaurant time range

I decided to follow the sugestion od using Koa.js so i could test Koa.js wich i had not use it yet.

To keep it simple i have decided to keep the bookings on the tables collection as a property of the document.
on a real application i would probably have the reservations on a different collection 
so i would manage it better with transactions.

I have decided to not allow editing the booking time, since i am using the datetime to indentify the booking.
then the booking can be removed and recreated on the desired date.

Currently the tests need the mongo container to be up and the database to be clean and the 
local database must have collections named setting and tables.

missing: 
    - clearing collections before/after test or using a different database for testing
    - better request validations
